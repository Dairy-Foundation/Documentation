## documentation
for now a repository of markdown files

## contributing 
check out the issues tab to see what still needs to be worked on, as well as adding
topics that have not yet been added.

when creating pages for topics, create three pages:

> 1. **intro**, aimed at introducing a concept, and covering the topic for the more inexperienced/high-level programmer.
     basic theory if applicable, and high-level usage.
> 2. **mid**, aimed at covering the full depth theory and usage for an advanced library user
> 3. **full**, aimed at covering the full depth theory including reasons for design decisions, aimed at people doing
   super in depth stuff, and library development

in terms of file structure, follow the example for the units system: 
`Package/topic/[introduction | advanced | developer].md`
